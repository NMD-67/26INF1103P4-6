# **SITogether**

| AI Feature                                   | How AI is Utilized                                                                                                           | AI Output/Recommendation                                                                                                         |
| :------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Compatibility Matching**                   | AI will analyse user’s profiles, to identify similarities between two students.                                              | Generates a **_Compatibility Score_** and highlights key areas of similarity.                                                    |
| **Personalised Match Recommendations**       | AI analyses a user’s profile together with profiles they liked or skipped, to better understand their preferences over time. | Recommends students who are more likely to be compatible with a user and improves on future matchmaking suggestions.             |
| **Conversations & Date Suggestions**         | AI uses information from both matched user’s profiles and shared interests to generate personalised suggestions.             | Provides both users with: Conversation Starters Common-Interest Topics Possible Date Activities Relevant SIT Events              |
| **Content Safety & Moderation**              | AI analyses messages and profile content for potentially inappropriate behavior.                                             | Flags potentially harmful content for review and warns users where appropriate. Repeated or serious violations are escalated.    |
| **Profile Image Verification**               | AI analyses uploaded profile images for signs of manipulated, AI-generated or duplicated images.                             | Assigns a risk/verification result and flags suspicious images for further review rather than automatically banning the student. |
| **Match Feedback & Compatibility Analytics** | AI analyses feedback after matches, such as whether users continued chatting or mutually liked each other.                   | Identifies patterns associated with successful matches and uses them to improve future compatibility recommendations.            |

## Technical Documentation

### About

This program's main interface is using the command line, as it is the minimum requirement for the project. In addition to the command line, we are also planning to add a Telegram Bot/Web Interface. Therefore, the structure of our program will be planned with these extensions in mind.

#### Program Structure

```
project/
|---src/
|   |---auth.py           //Handles user CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
|   |---ai_manager.py     //Handles API calls to AI systems
|   |---logic_manager.py  //Handles user matching based on AI results
|   |---email.py          //Email service for auth
|---cli/
|   |---main.py           //The file to run the app via CLI
|---tele/
|   |---bot.py            //The logic behind the tele bot
|---api/
|   |---server.py         //The server used for web interface
|---database/
|   |---db.py             //Handles the connection to the database
```

#### User fields

```py
{
  student_id: int,
  name: str,
  birthday: int/datetime,
  gender: str,
  year: int,
  course: str,
  bio: str,               #Optional

  hobbies: [str],
  interest_groups: [str], #Optional
  insta_handle: str,      #Optional
  tele_handle: str        #Optional
}
```

##### How to add user as JSON

Go to `/database/db` and scroll to the bottom. There is an example of how it can be done. Simply replace the `student_json` object with the one you wanna import.

#### auth.py

This file contans all the functions and modules for user handling. Note that as the functions require updating of the database, all the functions are asynchronious. The functions are as such:
| Function | Parameters | Return | Remarks |
|---|---|---|---|
|Login | student_id `int` | status `int` | Returns a [http status](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Status) depending on the progress of the login |
|GetUserInfo | student_id `int` | User JSON `object` | Returns all the info on a user based on their studentID |
|UpdateUserInfo | student_id `int` | status `int` | Returns a [http status](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Status) depending on the progress of the update |
|DeleteUser | student_id `int`| status `int` | Returns a [http status](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Status) depending on the progress of the deletion |
